### [Constraining modified gravity models through strong lensing cosmography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09910)

The repository **CMGM_SLC** comprises two folders:

- **Observational_data**: This folder contains a data file comprising a compilation of strong-lensing systems. For further information, please refer to the associated [paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/498/4/6013/5904771)
- **Python**: This folder contains a Python script implementing the lensing equations and utilizing a Monte Carlo algorithm to constrain the model's free parameters with the provided data.
