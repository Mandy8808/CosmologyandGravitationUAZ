# Cosmology and Gravitation - UAZ
<img align="right" width="25%" src="galleries/UA_UAZ.png">

This repository is a compilation of various numerical tools developed by the Cosmology and Gravitation group at the [Unidad Académica de Física](https://fisica.uaz.edu.mx) affiliated with the [Autonomous University of Zacatecas](https://www.uaz.edu.mx).

The numerical codes available in the repository were created with the support of the project _Null Geodesics Around Black Holes in Modified Gravity_ and were developed within the framework of the publications detailed below.

## Publications List and its repository folders

The repository **CMGM_SLC** comprises two folders:

- **Observational_data**: This folder contains a data file comprising a compilation of strong-lensing systems. For further information, please refer to the associated [paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/498/4/6013/5904771)
- **Python**: This folder contains a Python script implementing the lensing equations and utilizing a Monte Carlo algorithm to constrain the model's free parameters with the provided data.

## About the group
Our research focuses on exploring and identifying potential signatures of alternative models to general relativity, both at the cosmological scale and within compact objects. Additionally, within the framework of general relativity, we investigate possible signatures from compact objects composed of non-baryonic matter.
