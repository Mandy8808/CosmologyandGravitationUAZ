### [Horndeski stars](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2021/10/022)

The repository **Horndeski_Stars** comprises three folders: 

- **Acretion**: This folder contains Mathematica and Python notebooks where we computed the emissivity properties (power spectrum) of a geometrically thin, optically thick, steady accretion disc around a static (beyond) Horndeski compact object. We were inspired by the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S055032130200038X?via%3Dihub).
- **Lensing**: This folder contains Mathematica notebooks that compute the Particle Number and Total Energy for Horndeski stars. Additionally, it includes calculations for other quantities such as the ISCO radius and lensing profile.

- **Beyond_Horndeski**: This folder includes Mathematica notebooks used to compute different classes of Horndeski compact objects. These configurations were reported in the referenced paper.
